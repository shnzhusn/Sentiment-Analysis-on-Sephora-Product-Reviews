# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis on Sephora Product Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis and opinion mining on Sephora product reviews. It uses both traditional machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM) and transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) was also implemented to extract specific aspects mentioned in each review and determine sentiment for those aspects, providing a more detailed view of customer feedback.

> **Note**: Due to size limits, the dataset is not included in this repository. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and can be downloaded separately.

## ðŸ”® Future Work

In future iterations, the project can be improved by training on a larger and more diverse dataset to boost model accuracy, especially for neutral sentiment classes. Real-time sentiment monitoring and dashboard integration can also be added to make the insights more accessible for business decision-making. Additionally, integrating multilingual sentiment support and using more advanced ABSA models like SpanBERT or T5 could further enhance the quality of aspect extraction and sentiment classification.
